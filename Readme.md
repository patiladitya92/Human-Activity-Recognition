# Human Activity Recognition

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) involves the use of sensor data to identify 
various human activities, leveraging advanced techniques like deep learning to improve 
accuracy and efficiency. It has emerged as a critical area of research due to its 
wide ranging applications in fields such as healthcare, fitness, security, and human-computer 
interaction. Traditional HAR systems often relied on classical machine learning or 
rule based models, which struggled with the complexity of human motion. With advancements 
in technologies such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM) networks, modern HAR systems now excel at capturing temporal and 
spatial dependencies, enabling robust and accurate activity recognition in diverse 
environments. These developments have made HAR systems increasingly valuable for 
real-time applications like health monitoring, smart homes, and automated surveillance. 
 The motivation behind this project stems from the growing need for accurate 
and efficient HAR systems in real-world scenarios. Understanding human activities is 
essential for enhancing automation in smart environments, ensuring safety in healthcare 
monitoring, and improving user experiences in interactive systems. The primary objective 
of this project is to develop an LSTM-based model capable of classifying human activities 
using sensor data, addressing the limitations of traditional methods by leveraging deep 
learning techniques. The scope of this project includes developing a system that classifies 
basic activities like walking, running, and sitting from live video and sensor inputs. 
Additionally, it aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of HAR systems, paving the 
way for their application in healthcare, fitness monitoring, and human-computer 
interaction
